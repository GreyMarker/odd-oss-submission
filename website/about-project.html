    <h2>AR-experience</h2>
        <h6>In our AR experience, we invite users to engage with the concept of data privacy in a tactile and visual way. The setup consists of a MacBook and a collection of library-style cards, representing datasets that have been borrowed or accessed. By bringing the abstract concept of data borrowing into the physical world, we draw a direct parallel between data and the familiar act of borrowing books from a library.</h6>

    <h2>The Library Card</h2>
    <h6>Each card looks like a traditional library card, showing basic details without AR, such as when a specific set of data was borrowed and by whom—always Apple. The cards also display the file name and the owner's name, as the data comes from both me and my teammate. This design highlights how, even though data is stored on personal devices, it is often accessed or managed by corporations. By using physical cards, we make the usually hidden process of data transactions more visible and relatable, similar to borrowing a book from a library.</h6>

      <h2>AR-interaction</h2>
      <h7>To explore the details of each dataset further, users must scan the library cards using their smartphones. As they scan, the AR interface reveals in-depth information about the data, including what it consists of, what it is used for, and how it can be misused. The act of scanning, however, requires users to hol the cards in an uncomfortable position. This deliberate friction is designed to mirror the real-world frustrations of navigating Apple’s often complex and tedious data request processes. We wanted to draw attention to the fact that, despite claims of transparency, accessing personal data can be a troublesome experience for users.
